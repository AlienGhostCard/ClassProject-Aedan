        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Pixel palace place was started by someone, and that someone was mr. Pixel Palace Place or mr PPP. He started it in 2024, 4/18 and named it Pixel Palace Place, after his own name. Pixel Palace Place started out as a small store in arkansas, but withing hours of it being open, it opened 2 more stores. Pixel Palace Place has had constant hiring issues within point two and point three. Point two is so understaffed, it can stay open for 3 hours 2 days of the week, and 1 hour the rest of the week.</p>
        <p>Within Pixel Palace Place there has been constant interesting news. At point three there has been a promotion since the beginning of Pixel Palace Place. If you were to sign up today, you will get a chance to have 0.01% off your next purchase if that purchase is under $4.00 and is purchased at store point three between 1:50pm and 2:00pm on a sunday. It has brought in many customers and is currently the main reason why customers pick this store over any other store. Some other recent news is that Pixel Palace Place has just began selling Tic Tac Toe at store point one. There is also going to be a tournament at store point one at 5/10/2024 5:00pm for PacMan. </p>
